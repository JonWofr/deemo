# Deemo

With Deemo you can mint audio memos like sounds, vocals, noises as NFTs on the Polygon blockchain.

## The challenge

Deemo was built within a 3-day long weekend challenge. The challenge consisted of building a decentralised application from A-Z with a set of technologies like Next.js, tailwindcss, wagmi etc. that would use the Polygon blockchain within the specified timeframe.

## The result

After coming up with the idea and creating a basic design mockup I built a dApp with Next.js that lets you select/record memos. A memo can then be minted on Polygon with the help of the wagmi library. The NFT data is stored on IPFS. All existing Deemos (decentralised memos) are shown and can be listened to on the website.
